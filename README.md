# Nikuri

Project name: Nikuri

Nikuri is a small idle game made in Godot. You take control of a small ball-shaped creature and your goal is to grow your hive. 
You do that by collecting sunlight through the hive and purchasable structures and water through hive and collecting droplets that spawn each morning.
These resources are then converted into biomass which is used for buying new plants and upgrading the hive.

Single player, no sound, monochrome. All assets are original and made by me.
